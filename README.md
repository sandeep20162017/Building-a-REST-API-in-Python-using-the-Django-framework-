Building a REST API in Python using the Django framework – Sandeep Kanao

Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x for this project to work properly. Also, make sure you use a virtual environment to isolate this project from other work you're doing on your computer.

Quickstart
Execute the following steps to get started:
•	pip install -r requirements.txt
•	python manage.py migrate
•	python manage.py createsuperuser

When this is done, execute the following command to run the application:
•	python manage.py runserver

Getting around in the application

The current version is limited to a REST api and admin interface. You can access these through the following URLs: #Sandeep Kanao

You can login using the super user you created earlier.
